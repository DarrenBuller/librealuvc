
1. Download pre-built Windows binaries
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/4.0.1/opencv-4.0.1-vc14_vc15.exe/download

2. Run the self-extracting executable - it will prompt for an install directory,
   we'll use D:\xlibs
   The binaries will be in D:\xlibs\opencv\build\x64\vc14\{bin,lib}
   Python module in D:\xlibs\opencv\build\python\cv2\python-3.6\cv2.cp36-win_amd64.pyd

3. There's a Windows batch-file to set temporary environment variables
   D:\xlibs\opencv\build\setup_vars_opencv4.cmd
   Edit env.bat if you're using a directory other than D:\xlibs
   
4. Once env.bat refers to the right setup_vars_opencv4.cmd, you should be able
   to run minimum.bat or cameraControl.bat, and the scripts will set up the right
   PATH and PYTHONPATH before calling python.

5. Or you can set permanent variables like this
 
   setx PATH "%PATH%;D:\xlibs\opencv\build\x64\vc14\bin"
   setx PYTHONPATH "%PYTHONPATH%;D:\xlibs\opencv\python"
   
5. To configure cmake to build other software using these libraries,
   append to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH the directory "D:\xlibs\opencv\build", then
   cmake's find_package will be able to find the OpenCVConfig.cmake
